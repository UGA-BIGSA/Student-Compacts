    * Yearly review may make things more flexible.
    * Provides an opportunity to be reminded. 
    * Make it a discussion on the committee?
    * Maybe tie it to annual discussion with committee after comps.

* Keeping the compact dynamic important to maintain the health of the mentor-mentee relationship.
* Compact should empower the student as much as possible. 
    * No direct power, but it might provide some indirect power.
