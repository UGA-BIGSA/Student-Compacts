* Travis recommend a policy that have assurance that each student & mentor had a conversation going over major points. (Could be written document; doesn’t have to be the same for all.)
* Key point from grad students
    * Not 100% in consensus; main concern that could end up in contractual situation but only on student end, not PI
    * Maybe be centrally managed via IOB / vetted by IOB to make sure isn’t untoward
    * Concerned that student coming in vulnerable (e.g., never had a mentor/boss relationship before), so PI has better understanding of student than vice-versa
    * Anonymous evaluations of compacts & how being followed would be useful.
    * Realistically, has teeth for students but not for PIs. Some way to counterbalance?
* Question is: are students better or worse off in current status quo? If compact makes things better (albeit still not perfect), prob worth doing.
* Maybe terminology? “Compact” is formal; more just clarifying expectations?
* Without a way of enforcing the compact, what’s the point?
    * Compact meant to (1) make sure expectations are communicated, and (2) remind faculty of what those expectations are. Not really a mechanism for feedback.
    * Several faculty seem to try to keep explaining to the students why their viewpoint is incorrect. So many concerns indicate it’s not just a lack of understanding from students on what a compact’s purpose is. It is more that, regardless of that purpose, they are concerned about it being abused in practice.
* Concern that bad faculty could use the compact as a contract (since have more power), so students would like something to equalize.
* Concern that it would become a meaningless checkbox item
* Hard to change a mentor’s style anyway. Need to ask questions when rotating, not after joining lab.
* Feel that resources like committees, office staff, etc.
* What are other ways we could address the issue of miscommunicated expectations without the potential negatives above?
    * Have some sort of mentor-mentee conflict resolution training
    * IOB have a generic “normal expectations” document that students can discuss with PI.
